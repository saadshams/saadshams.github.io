P.S. An area of interest for us to talk about would be how I approach each Microservice Dev architecture by dividing it into Service Layer and Data Layers (SDKs, Libraries), each with its own unit tests. It's a hybrid approach combing both Object Oriented (Service) and Functional Paradigms (Data). More granularity and a decoupled approach while avoiding over-engineering.
